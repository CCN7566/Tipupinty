Here is some great VA Disability Claim information for you:
Starting with a great step by step guide to follow
üó£ How can I prepare for my VA Claim‚ÅâÔ∏è
</p><p>
1Ô∏è‚É£ Understand Benefits Delivery @ Discharge

</p><p>
2Ô∏è‚É£ Get all your medical concerns addressed. Make appointments with your PCM, specialists, physical/mental therapy, get new or updated prescriptions, etc.
</p><p>
3Ô∏è‚É£ Make sure your medical records are properly documented (preferably with a diagnosis). Going to Doc just for Motrin isn‚Äôt going to cut the mustard.
</p><p>
4Ô∏è‚É£ Get copies of medical records from ALL and ANY civilian hospitals you may have visited.
</p><p>
üí• Here‚Äôs a tip - sometimes TRICARE online will have uploaded ‚Äúdocuments‚Äù that didn‚Äôt make it to your AHLTA or paper jacket. Intake forms, questionnaires, supplemental data forms, etc.
